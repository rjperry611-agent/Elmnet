Entry point for the Elmnet proof of concept node.  This module
instantiates the orchestrator and a P2P network and exposes a
FastAPI application for handling HTTP based queries.  The previous
HTTP peer discovery mechanism has been replaced by the P2P network
implemented in :mod:`network`.  Nodes now discover one another via
bootstrap peers and exchange queries over persistent socket
connections.
